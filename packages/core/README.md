# @smdn/core

The Core library which contains reusable React components. This library is intended for personal non-commercial projects only as I am currently creating this library at an attempt to envision my own design language and for documentation purposes. Therefore, this is still unstable and in an exploration phase.

## Get started

To install the package run:

```
yarn add @smdn/core
```

Or if you are using npm run:

```
npm install --save @smdn/core
```

Then import the components in your React files like this:

```
import { Button } from '@smdn/core'
```
